Talk about punctuality. it's really good but the lecture delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching. so lack of knowledge in terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring. A teacher should be entertaining as well but they are really not. All they want us to be studios and disciplined which is really not the thinking of every student.,neutral

As he expects us to deliver answer in the way he wants us to do.
